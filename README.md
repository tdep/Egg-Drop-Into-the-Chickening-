# Egg-Drop-Into-the-Chickening-
A little game I made for the course CS50 in order to learn about Scratch amongst other aspects of computer science. 


In order to play:

Download the .sb2 file to your computer, then go to scratch.mit.edu/ and select "Load from computer".

THe object of the game is to "catch" the falling eggs before they hit the ground. Meanwhile, the patrolling hen will get progressively interested in what you're doing and try to stop you. Beware the chicks!
